# Quadruped Robot

The project involves the overall development of the quadruped robot and its working mechanisms. The main goal of the project was to achieve tasks mentioned in the ABU ROBOCON 2019 theme. The robot had to perform the following tasks - 
1. Walking
2. Climbing and Descending a Step
3. Waling over a Rope
4. Climbing a 15Â° Slope.

This project was created by TEAM ROBOCON KJSIEIT which comprised of total 20 members.

## Development of the Robot
We started with developing different mechanisms for the Quadruped robot in order to find the best suitable design of the robot in order to complete the required tasks.

### [Theo Jansen Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jansen%27s_linkage)

- At first the robot using Theo Jansen mechanism was designed. To start with this design we made a small prototype as shown below, which was successful. For increased stability a wheel was attached at the back pof the robot.

- After first successful try same design was scaled to make an even bigger model of the robot. The movement of the bigger model was closley examined.

- Issues Encountered: 
  The robot did not make a succesful run since the robot's design was not stable. The legs of the robot were made using wood which added more weight to the robot. Also because of the pointy head of the robot's leg the design became unstable. Moreover, this mechanism does not provide much maneuverability and direction control on the robot as compared to other Quadruped Robots.
